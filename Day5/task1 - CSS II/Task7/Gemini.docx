Task 7: Grid System and Breakpoints

A CSS grid system is a layout system that divides a page into rows and columns. It provides a flexible way to create complex layouts.

Example of a responsive layout using CSS grid:

.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));
  gap: 20px;

  @media (max-width: 768px) {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  }
}

.card {
  // ... card styles
}

Breakpoints:
Breakpoints are specific screen sizes at which the layout changes. In the example above, the layout changes at 768px.
